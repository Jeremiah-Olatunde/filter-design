##SUMMARY
Implementation of an FIR hamming window low pass filter


##FILTERS 
A filter is a device or process that removes some unwanted components or features from a signal. 
Filtering is a class of signal processing, the defining feature of filters being the complete or 
partial suppression of some aspect of the signal. This project aims to design a finite impulse response 
low pass filter with a hamming window function using python and signal processing libraries (scipy, matplotlib, numpy).
The filter is then tested on a given input signal and the results shown


##FILTER PARAMETERS
* cut off frequency = 0.0125
* order = 500
* type = Finite Impulse Response
* window = hamming
